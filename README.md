## Empathy in Action: Film, Simulation, and AI

To cultivate empathy, we combine:

### Cinematic Modeling
Introducing [Denise the Empathy Elephant™,](https://www.empathyproject.com/denise
) our educational film showcases the transformation from assumption-driven to curiosity-led interactions. In the classroom, we wrap guided discussion and reflection exercises around its narrative to catalyze learner engagement. 
The film was created by our unique think-tank of filmmakers and physician-educators.

### Immersive Practice
At our [New York Simulation Center for the Health Sciences](https://www.nysimcenter.org/sposce-programs) learners interact with trained ‘standardized patient’ actors in role-play scenarios, and receive expert feedback. This hands-on approach reinforces competency-based learning and objective skill assessment.
