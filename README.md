## Empathy in Action: Film, Simulation, and AI

To cultivate empathy, we combine:

### Cinematic Modeling
Introducing [Denise the Empathy Elephantâ„¢,](https://www.empathyproject.com/denise
) our educational film showcases the transformation from assumption-driven to curiosity-led interactions. In the classroom, we wrap guided discussion and reflection exercises around its narrative to catalyze learner engagement. 
The film was created by our unique think-tank of filmmakers and physician-educators.

### Immersive Practice
At our [New York Simulation Center for the Health Sciences](https://www.nysimcenter.org/sposce-programs) learners interact with trained â€˜standardized patientâ€™ actors in role-play scenarios, and receive expert feedback. This hands-on approach reinforces competency-based learning and objective skill assessment.

### AI-enhanced Learning
Supported by [an innovation grant](https://med.nyu.edu/departments-institutes/medicine/divisions/general-internal-medicine-clinical-innovation/program-medical-education-innovations-research/innovation-grants), we are exploring the intersection of AI and empathy education to develop adaptive learning tools that complement human expertise.
